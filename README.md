[12/9] Final Project Final Report
4-page long report in pdf. (3 contents + 1 ref + appendix as many as you want but optional)
Reference and appendix do NOT count.

Other file formats may result in the penalty in your final project score. 
I won't be able to review late submissions.
Feel free to submit your report before the deadline.

You CANNOT claim credits for years of your own research in this class, please be clear about the progress for this semester.
Also, do NOT claim credits for the same contribution in multiple classes. Explain your contributions only for this class.
For evaluation criteria, please refer to the attached slide.

* Introduction
- Motivation 
- Problem definition
- Concise description of contriubtion
* Methods
 - Significance/novelty/ (main challenges and how you address them)
  - Main figure,
  - Reproducibility-pseudocode (algorithm), formulation
* Experiments
 - Dataset
 - Computing resource (CPU,GPU, OS, pytorch etc.)
 - Experimental design/setup
 - Quantitative results / comparison with baselines, SOTA
 - Qualitative results / comparison with baselines, SOTA if possible
 - Figures (plots)/Tables and their analysis
 - Discussion why the proposed method is successful or unsuccessful 
* Future direction
* Any additional results can go to the appendix after main contents (3 pages) and reference. 

** Submit Zip file of your code, github address, a screenshot of our commit history **
